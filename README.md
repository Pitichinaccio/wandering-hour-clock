# Wandering Hour Clock

An improved version of 3D printed [wandering hour clock](https://www.printables.com/model/327198-improved-wandering-hour-clock).
Things I added:
- alternative SSID and password for WiFi connection
- sound output via DFplayer-module, strikes every hour and every 15 minutes (can be switched off via webinterface)
- automatic detection of DST (experimental)
- setting additional manual steps, e.g. for fine tuning of the position
- "easter egg", playing a certain soundfile at a specific date, e.g. a birthday song

## Instructions

### Hardware
- Ikea Bondis clock
- 3D printed parts and additional hardware listed from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/327198-improved-wandering-hour-clock), except ClockMovementGear and Standoffs
- 3D printed ClockMovementGear from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/429804-wandering-hour-clock-with-stepper-motor)
- Standoffs from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/476980-wandering-hour-clock-w-arduino-wifi-stepper-motor-)
- Any ESP board with wifi. e.g. ESP32, ESP8266
- 28BYJ-48 unipolar stepper motor
- ULN2003 motor driver
- 5V power supply (preferrably with 2A+)
- Jumper wires

### Wiring Diagram
- Wiring instructions for [ESP32](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-stepper-motor-28byj-48-uln2003/), [ESP8266](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-nodemcu-stepper-motor-28byj-48-uln2003/)

### Arduino Sketch
- The arduino code in this project adds the following additional features
  - Uses ESP32 with wifi for time from NTP
  - Provides a [web server](#web-server) for easier maintenance and troubleshooting

### Preferences
![Preferences](images/set_preferences.png)

Look up your [UTC offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_offsets) for standard time, and enter the value. If it is currently daylight saving time where you are, check the appropriate box. For example, in Newfoundland  (UTC-3:30) during the summer, the hour offset would be "-3", the minute offset would be "30" and the daylight saving time box should be checked.

The preference values are saved in non-volatile memory and will be retained after a power cycle. After making a change to the time zone, you will need to resynchronize the clock by using the web server to set the correct time.
